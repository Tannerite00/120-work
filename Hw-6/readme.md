# What I learned this week
- how to use objects in Java
- how to use the map() function to map a set of numbers to another set of numbers
- all the math I thought I knew, revamped in a new way

# What I could improve on
- my use of variables. I feel like I need to learn how to be more concise and how to use them better.
