## Things I learned
- loops are hard, but they are incredibly useful and can make 
tedious coding tasks quick and (relatively) painless
- let, is an interesting variable maker. I'd love to work more 
with this because most of the times I tried to implement it into my code it crashed. 
- Nested loops are even harder!! I am definitely going to have to practice these techniques more.
