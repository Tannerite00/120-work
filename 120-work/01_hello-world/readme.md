["Hello World! sketch] (https://tannerite00.github.io/120-work/120-work/01_hello-world/)

# Things I learned
1. How to draw using the draw function!
2. Specifically, how to draw ellipses
3. Also, how to make a canvas, as well as color its background an way I want

# Steps
-This week took me quite a long time to do, more to the fact that I got distractd by the cool new things we've learned
-I drew circles for hours
- and constantly refreshed my window, only to realize I didnt save in Atom and thats why nothing was changing. 

# Issues
The only difficulty I had was to do with my own incompetance of not understanding directions. 
once that was all cleared up everything else came naturally.
