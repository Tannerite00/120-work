Hoo boy was this a test of my knowledge. Origionally, I wanted to do a pong-esq game, with the paddle linked to the mouse, that could make the ball rebound. This turned out to be a dismal failure, as I think that having the mouse linked to the paddle made it so it was too quick to update a position or something, because I could not get them to recognize each other. Other balls - sure, no problem, makes perfect sense. But the rectangle and ball could not come together for a sweet union, rather, they ignored each other like ghosts. 

So, after a few days of trial and error, I decidede I had to scrap it and just go with what I know, and that is balls recognize each other when I have them all part of the same class, which brings me to my game of dodgeball. 

This entire semester has been beating my head against a wall until my code works. But, I have learned so much in this time period that the late night and headaches were worth it, and it will definetely help me as I go deeper into my Management Information Systems major. 

Thank you, Professor Musick, for helping me get started on my coding journey.
